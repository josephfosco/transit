Things to do when you
have to make a choice
and are out of time
------------
Be silent (rest)
Pick a random note
Make a quick choice


Store pitch as a index to a scale and an octave

melody? -> workspace
concepts -> slipnet
player/ensemble? -> coderack


-------------------

Things a player can be doing
- Playong a melody
  - notes generally of relatively same length
  - long notes at ends of phrases
  - quickest notes in flourishes (generally either up or down)
  - generally somewhat restricted range
- Playing primarily rhythmic material
  - maybe 1 or a few notes
- Playing random notes
- Playing accents
- Playing sustained notes
- Playing a counter melody
- Playing harmony (esp with long notes)
- Playing an ostinato (melody and/or rhythm)
- Listening - building up what it will do
- Accellerating
- Decellerating
- Getting Louder
- Getting Softer
- Playing Loud
- Playing soft

< ~ = Perhaps/Maybe>
- Look For local structures in other melodies
- ~ store the player id of the melody you are looking at
- ~ store the melody segment you are working with and
update it periodically
- ~ story melodies as pitch and rhythm/length (Rhythm would
require storing mm for each note)
- ~ store volume

Types of Local Structures
-------------------------

- arpeggio (nymber of notes)
- stepwise motion up/down
- repeated note
- step then leap
- leap (~ include scale degrees)
- non-harmonic/diatonic pitch(es)
- note then rest - or mostly rest
- sustained tones (predominately)
- rapid run up/down
- retrograde
- inverse
- augmentation (slowing down - if rhythm)
- diminution (speeding up - if rhythm)
- root
