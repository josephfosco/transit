ASYNC PROCESSING (messages)

Phase 1
When subscribing to a message player must not schedule new notes.

1. can-schedule is set to false in player so a new note is not scheduled.
2. A melody event with nil dur-info is placed as the next melody event
3. when a message arrives, it is placed on the pending message list for
the player and the player is scheduled to play the next note immediately.
4. The pending message(s) is/are processed before running player-methods

Phase 2
When subscribing to messages player can continue to play,
but new messages will not be processed until they start looking for
their next note.

Phase 3
When subscribing to messages player can continue to play, and messages
can interrupt their playing.
